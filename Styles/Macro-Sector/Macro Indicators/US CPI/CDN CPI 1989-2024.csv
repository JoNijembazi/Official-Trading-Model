3,"The Bank of Canada's measures of core inflation, CPI-common, CPI-median and CPI-trim, are subject to revision. In the case of CPI-median and CPI-trim, the revisions result from the fact that these measures are based on seasonally adjusted price index series. In the case of CPI-common, revisions are due to the statistical technique used, as the factor model is estimated over all available historical data. Table 18-10-0259-01 contains historical data for these three measures and is updated on a monthly basis."
4,"This measure is based on Consumer Price Index (CPI) series adjusted to remove the effect of changes in indirect taxes."
5,"CPI-common is a measure of core inflation that tracks common price changes across categories in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) basket."
6,"Eight of the most volatile components identified by the Bank of Canada include: fruit, fruit preparations and nuts; vegetables and vegetable preparations; mortgage interest cost; natural gas; fuel oil and other fuels; gasoline; inter-city transportation; and tobacco products and smokers' supplies."
7,"Differences in historical data exist between this table and table 176-0003.
